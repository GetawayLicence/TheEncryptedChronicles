## About Me 👩🏽‍💻

Hi, I’m Sruthi. I am in my penultimate year studying Computer Science at Nanyang Technological University, and am on track to specialise in Cybersecurity. I spend my days learning how to break things (ethically), secure systems, and trace the digital footprints left behind by code, criminals, or chaos.

Beyond the world of firewalls and forensics, I’m a lover of languages — both spoken and programmed. I speak Tamil, sing with a guitar or piano nearby, and occasionally get lost in the pages of romance novels or fanfiction. Whether it’s a Harry Potter theory spiral or a Swiftie-inspired coding playlist, there’s always something brewing in my brain.

This blog exists as my vault of musings, breakdowns, and deep dives into the encrypted underbelly of the digital world.

Hi, I’m Sruthi! I’m currently in my penultimate year of Computer Science at Nanyang Technological University, on track to specialise in Cybersecurity. I’m constantly exploring new ways to stay in tune with the ever-evolving cyber landscape, whether it’s through research, analysis, or just following digital breadcrumbs that lead somewhere unexpected.

Outside the world of code and cryptography, I’m always looking for stories — in books, in music, in conversations, in quiet moments. I tend to see patterns where others might not, and I find comfort in exploring the abstract just as much as the concrete.

This blog began as a personal experiment — a space to jot down passing thoughts, unpack incidents that caught my attention, and dive deeper into topics I wanted to understand better. Over time, it’s become a kind of chronicle: not just of tech, but of the questions and curiosities that keep me going.

## About the Blog 🔐

**The Encrypted Chronicles** is where cybersecurity meets storytelling.

It’s part journal, part archive, and part creative exploration — a collection of thoughts, research, breakdowns, and reflections on all things digital. From dissecting ransomware trends to demystifying cryptographic algorithms, this space exists to make sense of the encrypted world we live in.

But it’s not just technical. It’s thoughtful.

This blog is here for the curious — those who want to peek behind the digital curtain, trace the lines of code back to their origin stories, and maybe even see a little poetry in the patterns.

Whether you're a fellow student, a techie on the hunt for clarity, or someone just wandering through the maze — welcome to the Chronicles.
